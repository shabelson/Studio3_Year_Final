# This script works with the Orbbec Astra series RGBD cameras.
# This script only works with x64 (not x86) architecture.
# This script only works on Windows.


# If the Orbbec drivers haven't been installed, download the Orbbec OpenNI SDK here:
# https://orbbec3d.com/develop
# In this directory, you will find the executable 
# OpenNI_2.3.0.55 > Windows > Astra OpenNI2 Development Instruction(x64)_V1.3 > Driver > SensorDriver_V4.3.0.9.exe
# Run this exe file and follow the installation prompts. 
# When you plug in an orbbec sensor, it should be recognized without any error in the DeviceManager.
# If there is an error, try uninstalling and reinstalling the driver.

# Run setlib_environ.bat in the directory here:
# OpenNI_2.3.0.55 > Windows > Astra OpenNI2 Development Instruction(x64)_V1.3 > OpenNI2 > OpenNI-Windows-x64-2.3.0.55 > Redist

# Ensure that python is installed and that the following python modules
# are installed using pip:
# opencv-python, numpy, primesense

# Make sure to pass the correct path to the openni2 Redist folder. 
# The correct Redist folder should be located in
# OpenNI_2.3.0.55 > Windows > Astra OpenNI2 Development Instruction(x64)_V1.3 > OpenNI2 > OpenNI-Windows-x64-2.3.0.55 > Redist
# This folder should contain
